**Learn** - *to gain knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something.*

It is something we all do from the moment of birth, so most of us likely take this very complex process for granted. How often have you spent hours upon hours trying to learn something, only to find yourself in agony over getting nowhere?
So, when do you need to learn? what do you need to learn? and why? These are questions I’ve given some serious thought over the past few years. But first…

### My background
As many of you, I’m self taught. I’ve never taken a class on design or programming. I have, however, always had a general interest in IT and technology.

When it came time for me to decided what I wanted to do with my life, the decision naturally fell on a degree in computer science. I spent my time delving deep into network and server maintenance.

My first encounter with HTML happened quite by chance. I was preparing a presentation and wanted an alternative to Microsoft's PowerPoint. I wanted my presentation to stand out. And as I was googling for alternatives it suddenly dawned on me. "Why not make a simple website out of it?" After all, how hard could that be?

As it turns out, it was pretty hard. I did manage to build a thing, and was quite proud of it. It was a simple site with a few links and images and far too much text! But it sparked something in me. I'd created something, though hideous, I'd made something with nothing but the power of my imagination.

This sent me on a journey that continues till this day. Learning new things every day.
