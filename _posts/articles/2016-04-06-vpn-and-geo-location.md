I've been using a VPN for a few weeks now, but realized that despite my IP correctly reflecting the VPN server location, the browser would still show my actual location.

After a bit of research it occurred to me that most browsers are configured to use alternate location services. Most commonly the wifi network information will be used as there are vast databases, which map wifi networks to geographic locations (usually generated by by Google Street View cars and the like).
